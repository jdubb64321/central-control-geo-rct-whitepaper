# Central Control Geo RCT Whitepaper

**Author(s):** Jason Wertheimer  
**Date:** August 2025

## Abstract
*At Central Control, we have written several articles1 advocating for advertisers to measure
incremental return on ad spend (iROAS) by using large-scale geographic randomized
controlled trials (RCT). This article provides a detailed explanation of how to design and
execute such experiments.
Those previous writings covered extensively why geo experiments offer the best evidence of whatâ€™s
working in your marketing mix compared to user-level experiments, quasi-experiments (e.g., synthetic
control, matched market tests), attribution, and other observational methods. This piece focuses on how:
the practical implementation of high-quality large-scale geographic RCTs.*
