▲ This workflow summarizes the end-to-end process for running advertising experiments. The final stage –
benchmarking – compiles results from all experiments into a growing evidence base. As advertisers, agencies,
and media companies accumulate dozens, then hundreds, or even thousands of tests, these benchmarks become a
powerful source of insight. They reveal what truly works in advertising and provide expected effect sizes by media
channel, ad format, partner, product category, and other key dimensions.",,,,
