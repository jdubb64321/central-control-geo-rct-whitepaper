▲ This diagram shows a test structure for evaluating the sales impact of media. It is useful for testing in a new channel but also as a,,,,
cessation test for pausing an always-on media channel the advertiser believes is essential to sales. We have nicknamed this design type,,,,
"“Rolling Thunder.” In this example, four treatment groups are turned off in staggered 4-week windows to minimize overall disruption.",,,,
"At any given time, only a subset of the country is in test: in this example, typically one-sixth, and at most one-third (in weeks 4, 7, and 10).",,,,
Multiple control groups and spacing between test flights reduce risk. Rules for halting the test based on observed negative impact should,,,,
"be pre-specified during the design phase. The configuration, including number of test arms, treatment duration, and control size, should",,,,
be guided by pre-test power analysis to ensure detectability of the expected effect size.,,,,
